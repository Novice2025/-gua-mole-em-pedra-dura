                <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6 shadow-inner border-l-4 border-teal-500">

                        Literally: "Soft water on hard stone, it hits so much that it drills a hole."
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        This is a classic Brazilian proverb that beautifully illustrates the power of persistence. It's a reminder that even something as gentle and seemingly powerless as a drop of water can, over time, wear down and eventually pierce a solid rock.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        The core message is that **continuous, consistent effort**‚Äîno matter how small‚Äîcan overcome massive obstacles. It's about not giving up, even when the challenge seems impossible. The key isn't in a single burst of strength, but in the steady repetition of action.

                        While there's no direct, popular translation, several English sayings capture the same spirit of the proverb:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700 ml-4">
                        <li>
                            **"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again."** This is the most common and direct moral equivalent.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            **"Slow and steady wins the race."** This phrase emphasizes the methodical, unhurried nature of the effort.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            **"Where there's a will, there's a way."** This captures the determination aspect.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            **"Persistence pays off."** A straightforward and modern way to express the same idea.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                        You can use this proverb to encourage someone facing a tough situation, from a student struggling with a difficult class to a salesperson trying to land a big client.

                    <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        **For example:**
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700 ml-4">
                        <li>
                            **In sports:** "I know you missed that shot a hundred times, but keep practicing. Remember, *√°gua mole em pedra dura...* (Persistence pays off!)"
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            **At work:** "Getting that new feature approved is a challenge, but just keep presenting the benefits. You know what they say: *√°gua mole em pedra dura...* (Slow and steady wins the race.)"
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            **Learning a language:** "It's hard to remember all the vocabulary, but just study for 15 minutes every day. *√Ågua mole em pedra dura...* (If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.) and you'll be fluent before you know it."
                        </li>
